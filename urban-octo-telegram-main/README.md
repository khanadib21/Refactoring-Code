# Module 1 Challenge

## Overview
Assingment for this week was to refactor a code which was already written and executed to make it simpler and easier for any coder to read. Here I have commented out a lot of repititive codes without which the website runs perfectly, these are basically creating a noise. I added Semantics to help disabled people browse through the website. Coded where I have made changes on the HTML and CSS file.
